*Open*: Alameda is being developed and maintained as open-source software. We encourage contributions and feedback from the community at-large.

*Platform-independent*: Alameda is not targeted at any specific deployment environment. During the initial stages of development, Alameda will support
Kubernetes and Openshift deployments. However, Alameda is being built to enable rapid and easy adaptation to other environments.

*Service mesh*: Alameda is designed to manage communications between microservices and applications. Without requiring changes to the underlying services, Alameda provides automated baseline traffic resilience, service metrics collection, distributed tracing, traffic encryption, protocol upgrades, and advanced routing functionality for all service-to-service communication.
