This page lists the relative maturity and support
level of every Alameda feature. Please note that the phases (Alpha, Beta, and Stable) are applied to individual features
within the project, not to the project as a whole. Here is a high level description of what these labels means:

### Core

| Feature           | Phase
|-------------------|-------------------
| [Kubernetes: Alameda Installation](/docs/setup/kubernetes/)        | Alpha
| [Helm](/docs/setup/kubernetes/helm-install/) | Alpha
