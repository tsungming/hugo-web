Alameda is an open source project with an active community that supports its use and on-going development. We'd love for you
to join us and get involved!

There are quite a few ways to get plugged in with the Alameda community:

<table class="community">
  <tbody>

    <tr>
      <td class="logo"><img src="/img/github.png" alt="GitHub"/></td>
      <td class="desc">
        <a href="https://github.com/containers-ai/alameda">GitHub</a> is where development takes place on Alameda code.
      </td>
    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>
